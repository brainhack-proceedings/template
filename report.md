# Introduction
The bibliography \code{report.bib} must respect \href{http://www.bibtex.org/Using/}{BibTeX} format. 
You can cite entries in your bibliography using their tags:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cite an article: \cite{author:2010}
  \item Cite a GitHub repository: \cite{githubrepo:2020}
\end{itemize}

\smallskip
\noindent You can use \code{inline code highlight}. This paragraph shows how to add blank lines and how to start a paragraph without indentation.

Remember that this is a LaTex flavored markdown. Therefore, some characters must be used with an escape character within the text:

\code{\& \% \$ \# \_ \{  \} \textbackslash}


# Section
You can create additional sections as you prefer. Section title levels are determined by the number of hastags as in a traditional markdown file.

## Subsection
Subsection content goes here. You can create numerated lists:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The labels consists of sequential numbers.
  \item The numbers starts at 1 with every call to the enumerate environment.
\end{enumerate}

### Equations & formulas
You can add mathematical formulas. Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$.
\smallskip

\noindent You can also use plain LaTeX for equations. These equations are rendered by MathJax, you can right click on them and explore the rendering options available at your browser!

\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}

and refer to \ref{eq:1} from text.

### Hypothes.is 
We enabled \href{https://web.hypothes.is/}{hypothes.is} for the brainhack proceeding reports. This way, you can annotate, highlight and tag the content collaboratively! You may choose to share your insights with everyone, or keep them private.      

# Results
Figure files must be placed at the \code{figures} folder. You can include figures using the following block:

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{brainhack.png}

  \caption{\label{Figure-1} Your caption goes here.}

\end{figure}

Note that \code{width=.47 \textbackslash textwidth} above sets scales the figure size in the PDF. To change attributes of the figures on the webpage, please see \code{/figures/figures.css}. 

To refer a figure in the text, you need to use the respective label defined in its caption: Fig. \ref{Figure-1}
